$title=Basic Software Install List

This is simply a list of useful tools/software I normally install on every Linux server I administrate:

+ htop – FAR better version of top
+ dstat – excellent monitoring of whole-server resources
+ iotop – catch heavy IO processes
+ ddos-deflate – no reason not to install, very basic protection

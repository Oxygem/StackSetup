Welcome to Stack Setup. A collection of useful Linux related tutorials, designed to be run via SSH/console. Basic-intermediate experience is assumed on most pages; often these tutorials are more like notes taken when building a stack than actual step by step guides. They should provide enough information to anyone setting up similar stacks. Hosted & maintained by [Afterburst Unmetered VPS](http://afterburst.com).
